LaTeX resources for introductory labs for students studying Python 3.x

This assumes no prior programming knowledge and is designed to give a quick introduction to some key language concepts. In some places, a less Pythonic approach is taken in order to make the lessons more transferable to other programming languages.

Please note that I am currently in the process of tidying this up a bit, but some people still want access to them, so here they are. This year I'm doing screen casts of the labs, which I have shared with a few people outside my students. I may make them fully public in due course.

## LaTeX Source

The `latex` directory contains LaTeX source for the labs.

## Python Files

The `python` directory contains some of the final programs produced or initial programs to make it easier for demonstrators, but also for students to check their work.
